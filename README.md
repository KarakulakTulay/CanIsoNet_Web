We have recently analyzed the pathogenic impact of isoform switching events in 1209 cancer samples covering 27 different cancer types. Expanding on those results, we have built a user-friendly Cancer Isoform Specific Interaction Network (CanIsoNet) database to make our results more accessible to the cancer research community.
CanIsoNet is the first webserver that merges isoform switching events in different cancer types with their functional impact level and showing them on STRING interaction network.
It holds a rich set of annotations on over 120000 isoform switching events, including network visualizations for 93738 isoforms using STRING.
CanIsoNet provides two main functionalities to the users:
1) Browsing various statistics on cancer-specific isoform switching events in each 1209 cancer samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project.
2) Exploring and visualizing network disruptions in the STRING interaction network.
